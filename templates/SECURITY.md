### Security Bugs

Pagar.me has a very strict security culture. Therefore, if any of our projects have any vulnerability that can affect our customers, we have an email for safe disclosure. With that in mind, please do not file public issues; go through the process outlined below.

Please send an email to [security@pagar.me](mailto:security@pagar.me) and describe the bug and the best way to reproduce them. We will reply as soon as possible and do our best to fix the bug as fast as possible too. If there is any sensible data on that email, please encript that using our [gpg key](pagar.me/security.pub)
